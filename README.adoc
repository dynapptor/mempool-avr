= Memory Pool Library

== Overview

The Memory Pool Library provides a lightweight and efficient memory management system designed for Arduino and other resource-constrained embedded systems. It allows dynamic memory allocation and deallocation with fixed-size memory segments, reducing fragmentation and improving performance in environments with limited RAM.

== Features

- Dynamic memory allocation with fixed-size segments
- Support for multiple segment sizes
- Efficient bit-mapped allocation tracking
- Debug features for allocation statistics
- Template-based allocation for type-safe memory management

== Installation

1. Download the library as a ZIP file from the repository.
2. In the Arduino IDE, go to `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library` and select the downloaded file.
3. The library is now available for use in your sketches.

== Usage

See the `examples` folder for sample sketches demonstrating how to use the library. A basic example is provided in `examples/mempool_example/mempool_example.ino`.
